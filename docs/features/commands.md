# Commands Reference

Type `/` in the chat input to see available commands. All commands start with `/` and can be invoked at any point during a session.

## Built-in Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/help` | Show available commands |
| `/init` | Initialize project with intelligent analysis, create AGENTS.md and configuration files. Use `/init --force` to regenerate AGENTS.md if it already exists, or `/init --lean` to skip merging `CLAUDE.md` content into the generated AGENTS.md |
| `/setup-providers` | Interactive wizard for configuring AI providers with templates |
| `/setup-mcp` | Interactive wizard for configuring MCP servers with templates |
| `/setup-config` | Open a configuration file in your `$EDITOR` (lists project and global config files) |
| `/clear` | Clear chat history |
| `/model` | Switch between available models from any configured provider |
| `/status` | Display current status (CWD, provider, model, theme, available updates, AGENTS setup) |
| `/tasks` | Manage task list for tracking complex work (see [Task Management](task-management.md)) |
| `/model-database` | Browse coding models from OpenRouter (searchable, filterable by open/proprietary) |
| `/settings` | Interactive menu to access Nanocoder settings (theme, title-shape, nanocoder-shape, paste-threshold) |
| `/mcp` | Show connected MCP servers and their tools |
| `/custom-commands` | List all custom commands |
| `/checkpoint` | Save and restore conversation snapshots (see [Checkpointing](checkpointing.md)) |
| `/compact` | Compress message history to reduce context usage (see [Context Compression](context-compression.md)) |
| `/context-max` | Set maximum context length for the current session, or inspect the resolved context source. Also available as `--context-max` CLI flag |
| `/exit` | Exit the application |
| `/export` | Export current session to markdown file |
| `/copy` | Copy the last assistant response to the system clipboard |
| `/commit` | Generate a Conventional Commit message from staged Git changes |
| `/doctor` | Show environment health report for bug reports |
| `/update` | Update Nanocoder to the latest version |
| `/usage` | Get current model context usage visually |
| `/lsp` | List connected LSP servers |
| `/schedule` | Read-only view of cron subscriptions declared by skills (see [Skills → Event subscriptions](skills.md#event-subscriptions)) |
| `/skills` | List and inspect loaded skills; scaffold new bundle skills with AI assistance (see [Skills](skills.md)) |
| `/resume` | Resume a previous chat session (aliases: `/sessions`, `/history`). Also available at launch via the `--resume`/`--continue` CLI flags. See [Session Management](session-management.md) |
| `/retry` | Re-run the last user turn. Use `/retry --model <id>` or `/retry --provider <name> --model <id>` to switch models first |
| `/rename` | Rename the current session. Name must be non-empty and 100 characters or less. See [Session Management](session-management.md) |
| `/explorer` | Interactive file browser to navigate, preview, and select files for context |
| `/tune` | Configure runtime model behaviour — tool profiles, compaction, native tools, model parameters (see [Tune](tune.md)) |
| `/ide` | Connect to an IDE for live integration (e.g., VS Code diff previews) |

## Special Input Syntax

These shortcuts work directly in the chat input — no `/` prefix needed.

| Syntax | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `!command` | Execute bash commands directly without leaving Nanocoder (output becomes context for the LLM) |
| `@file` | Include file contents in messages via fuzzy search — press Tab to select from suggestions |
| `@file:10-20` | Include specific line range from a file (line 10 to 20) |
| `@file:10` | Include a single line from a file |

### File Mentions

The `@` syntax triggers real-time fuzzy matching as you type. Nanocoder searches your project files (respecting `.gitignore`) and shows autocomplete suggestions. Press **Tab** to accept a suggestion.

You can narrow the context by specifying line ranges:

```
What does this function do? @src/utils.ts:45-80
Explain the error on @src/app.tsx:23
```

### Shell Commands

The `!` prefix runs a command in your shell and includes the output as context for the AI:

```
!git log --oneline -10
!npm test -- --filter auth
```

## Non-Interactive Mode

Run Nanocoder without an interactive session for scripting and automation:

```bash
nanocoder run "Add error handling to src/api.ts"
```

This submits the prompt and exits when complete. Useful for CI pipelines, git hooks, or chaining with other tools.

Run mode renders through a dedicated minimal shell: no welcome banner, no boxed "You:" echo, no trailing token counts, no `ctrl+r to expand` hints. Assistant text streams as plain markdown, tools render chronologically as one-liners (e.g. `⚒ Read 1 file`), and a single status line below the transcript shows progress.

By default, `run` uses auto-accept. Override with `--mode` to boot into a different [development mode](development-modes.md):

```bash
# Plan only — no changes executed
nanocoder --mode plan run "analyze the auth module"

# No safety rails — auto-accepts every tool including bash
nanocoder --mode yolo run "update README and push"
```

If a tool requires approval that the active mode won't grant, nanocoder prints `Tool approval required for: ...` and exits with status code `1`.

Because there is nobody to answer a prompt in a `run`, the agent-loop [retry limits](../configuration/index.md#retry-limits) hard-stop instead of pausing: a model that repeats the same tool call, returns empty responses, or keeps emitting malformed tool calls past its configured cap ends the run with an error. Under the `--plain` runtime (used automatically in CI and non-TTY environments) the error names the limit that fired and the run exits with status code `1`.

> **Warning - CI polling patterns:** the repeated-call hard stop triggers on *legitimate* repetition too. If your workflow's model is expected to run the identical command repeatedly - polling a deploy, waiting on a slow job by re-running the same check - the run aborts once `maxRepeatedToolCalls` consecutive identical calls are emitted (default 3). Raise `nanocoder.retries.maxRepeatedToolCalls` in that project's `agents.config.json` before relying on such a pattern in CI.

### JSON Output

For CI pipelines, scripting, and tool chaining, pass `--json` (alias `--output-format json`) alongside `run` to get a single structured JSON object on `stdout` instead of streamed markdown:

```bash
nanocoder --plain --json run "Add error handling to src/api.ts"
```

With `--json` set, all human-readable output — boot banners, streamed tokens, tool one-liners, status lines — is suppressed from `stdout`. Anything nanocoder would otherwise print is instead routed to `stderr`, so `stdout` stays clean for piping:

```bash
nanocoder --plain --json run "refactor the auth module" | jq .finalText
```

`--json` requires `run` and is incompatible with `--acp` and `--vscode` — combining them exits with an error before the session starts.

#### Output Shape

The emitted object looks like:

```json
{
  "kind": "success",
  "exitCode": 0,
  "finalText": "...",
  "reasoning": "...",
  "toolCalls": [
    {
      "name": "edit_file",
      "arguments": { "path": "src/api.ts" },
      "result": "...",
      "error": null
    }
  ],
  "filesChanged": ["src/api.ts"],
  "usage": {
    "inputTokens": 4520,
    "outputTokens": 850,
    "totalTokens": 5370
  }
}
```

- `kind` — `"success"`, `"tool-approval-required"`, or `"error"`, matching the underlying conversation result
- `exitCode` — `0` for success, `1` for error, `2` for tool-approval-required; mirrors the process exit code
- `finalText` — the model's final response text
- `reasoning` — accumulated reasoning/thinking content, or `null` if the model didn't emit any
- `toolCalls` — every tool call made during the run, each with its arguments and either a `result` or an `error` (never both)
- `filesChanged` — deduplicated list of file paths touched by file-mutating tools (`write_to_file`, `create_file`, `string_replace`, `edit_file`)
- `usage` — provider-reported token counts summed across every turn of the run. Omitted entirely when the provider reports no token telemetry (common with local models), so an absent block means "unknown", never "zero". When a provider reports input and output counts but no total, `totalTokens` is derived as their sum.

Two more fields appear conditionally: `message` (the error text, when `kind` is `"error"`) and `toolNames` (the tools awaiting approval, when `kind` is `"tool-approval-required"`).

On error (e.g. an untrusted workspace directory, the turn limit being hit without a final answer, or an agent-loop [retry limit](../configuration/index.md#retry-limits) being hit), `kind` is `"error"` and the object still includes whatever `toolCalls` were captured before the failure, so partial progress isn't silently dropped.
