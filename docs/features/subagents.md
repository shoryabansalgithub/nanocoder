# Subagents

> **A subagent is one kind of skill member.** This page covers the

Subagents are specialized AI agents that the main agent can delegate tasks to. Each subagent runs in its own isolated conversation with its own system prompt, filtered tools, and optionally a different model or provider. Only the final result is returned to the main conversation, keeping your context window clean.

## How It Works

The main agent has access to an `agent` tool. When it decides a task would benefit from focused research, exploration, or specialized processing, it calls the `agent` tool with a subagent type and description. The subagent runs independently, executes tool calls as needed, and returns its findings.

You don't need to explicitly ask for a subagent — the main agent decides when delegation is appropriate based on the task.

### Parallel Execution

The main agent can call the `agent` tool multiple times in a single response. All agent calls execute in parallel for maximum efficiency. This is useful for independent research tasks — for example, exploring different parts of the codebase simultaneously.

A maximum of 5 agents can run concurrently. Excess calls receive an error and can be retried.

## Built-In Subagents

Nanocoder ships with one built-in subagent:

### explore

A codebase exploration agent. Use when you need to explore file structure, search for patterns, understand code, or gather context without filling your main conversation with search results.

```
Tools: read_file, search_file_contents, find_files, list_directory,
       lsp_get_diagnostics, git_status, git_log, git_diff
```

Use `/agents create <name>` or `/agents copy explore` to scaffold project-specific agents (e.g. a code reviewer, a test-writer, a security auditor) tailored to your codebase.

## Creating Custom Subagents

### With AI Assistance

```bash
/agents create code-reviewer
```

This creates a template at `.nanocoder/agents/code-reviewer.md` and prompts the AI to help you write the agent definition.

### By Copying a Built-In Agent

```bash
/agents copy explore
```

This copies the full definition of the `explore` agent (or any other agent) to `.nanocoder/agents/explore.md` so you can customize it. The project-level copy takes priority over the built-in, so your modifications take effect immediately.

This is the easiest way to tweak a built-in agent — adjust the system prompt, add or remove tools, change the model, etc.

### Manually

Create a markdown file in `.nanocoder/agents/` (project-level) or `~/.config/nanocoder/agents/` (user-level):

`.nanocoder/agents/code-reviewer.md`:

```markdown
---
name: code-reviewer
description: Reviews code for bugs, security issues, and style problems
model: inherit
contextWindow: 16384
tools:
  - read_file
  - search_file_contents
  - find_files
  - list_directory
---

You are a code review specialist. When given a file or directory to review:

1. Read the code carefully
2. Search for related files to understand context
3. Identify bugs, security issues, and style problems
4. Return findings with file paths and line numbers
```

## Frontmatter Reference

| Field | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `name` | Yes | — | Unique identifier for the subagent |
| `description` | Yes | — | When to use this agent (shown to the LLM) |
| `provider` | No | parent's | Provider name from `agents.config.json`. Set this to use a different API endpoint (e.g. `ollama` for local models) |
| `model` | No | `inherit` | Model ID available on the provider. Use `inherit` to use the parent's current model |
| `contextWindow` | No | provider/model default | Override the subagent's context window in tokens (e.g. `16384`) |
| `tools` | No | all | Array of tool names to allow. If set, only these tools are available |
| `disallowedTools` | No | none | Array of tool names to block |

The body after the frontmatter is the system prompt.

## Using a Different Provider

Subagents can use a completely different LLM provider than the main agent. This is useful for running cheap/fast local models for research while using a cloud model for the main conversation:

```markdown
---
name: local-research
description: Fast local codebase research using Ollama
provider: ollama
model: ministral-3:3b
tools:
  - read_file
  - search_file_contents
  - find_files
  - list_directory
---

You are a codebase research agent. Search and read files to answer questions.
Always use your tools — never guess.
```

The `provider` must match a provider name configured in your `agents.config.json`.

If you set `contextWindow`, Nanocoder creates that subagent with its own context limit override. This is useful when a lightweight research agent should run with a smaller local-model context than your main coding agent.

## Priority and Overrides

Subagent definitions are loaded from three sources in priority order:

1. **Project-level** (`.nanocoder/agents/`) — highest priority
2. **User-level** (`~/.config/nanocoder/agents/`) — medium priority
3. **Built-in** — lowest priority

A project-level agent with the same `name` as a built-in or user-level agent overrides it.

## Security

- Subagent tools respect the same approval rules as the main agent. Write tools and bash commands prompt the user for approval unless they are in the `alwaysAllow` list or the session is in auto-accept/yolo mode.
- The `tools` key in the agent definition controls which tools the subagent can access. Use this to restrict subagents to only the tools they need.
- The `alwaysAllow` setting in `agents.config.json` applies to tools within subagents, so you can configure which tools run without prompts.

## Loop Protection

A subagent that re-issues the identical tool call(s) on consecutive turns is stopped by the same [`maxRepeatedToolCalls`](../configuration/index.md#retry-limits) cap the main agent uses (default 3). There is nobody to ask inside a delegated run, so it never pauses: the run fails with an error naming the setting. Calls to nonexistent tools count toward the streak too, so a subagent stuck on a tool it doesn't have hits the same cap.

Whatever the subagent produced before it got stuck is still handed to the main agent under a `Partial output produced before stopping:` heading, so useful work isn't discarded along with the failure.

The other two retry limits don't apply to subagents: their loop ends on its own when a turn comes back with no tool calls (so `maxEmptyTurns` is moot), and they don't use text-parsed tool calls (so `maxMalformedRetries` is too). There is also no turn ceiling: apart from the repeated-call cap, a subagent runs until it stops calling tools or the main agent's run is cancelled.

## Development Modes and Tune Profiles

### Plan Mode

In plan mode, subagents can run but any write tools they attempt will require user approval (same as the main agent in plan mode). The built-in agents only have read tools configured, so they work seamlessly in plan mode.

### Scheduler Mode

Subagents are not available in scheduler mode. The `agent` tool is excluded because subagent execution requires user approval, which is not possible in non-interactive scheduler runs.

### Tune Profiles

The `agent` tool is included in both `full` and `minimal` tune profiles, so subagents are always available regardless of which profile you use. The subagent prompt section in the system prompt is only included when the `agent` tool is active.

## Managing Agents

### List All Agents

```bash
/agents
```

Shows all available subagents with their source (built-in vs custom), model, and tool count.

### View Agent Details

```bash
/agents show explore
```

Displays the full definition of an agent — description, source, provider, model, tools, and system prompt.

### Copy an Agent for Customization

```bash
/agents copy explore
```

Copies the agent definition to `.nanocoder/agents/<name>.md`. The project-level copy takes priority immediately, so you can edit the file and the changes take effect on the next agent invocation.

### Create a New Agent

```bash
/agents create my-agent
```

Creates a template and prompts the AI to help you write the definition.

## Live Progress

During subagent execution, a progress indicator shows:
- The subagent name and task description
- Number of tool calls made
- Estimated token count

When multiple agents run in parallel, each agent shows its own progress row. The progress updates in real-time as the agents work.
